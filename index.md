## About Me

I am a Medical Engineering and Medical Physics Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://hst.mit.edu/">Harvard-MIT Program for Health Sciences and Technology</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.collinslab.mit.edu/">Prof. James J. Collins</a> and funded by an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>. I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/">California Institute of Technology</a>, where my undergraduate research was supervised by <a href="https://henrylesterresearchgroup.caltech.edu/">Prof. Henry Lester</a> and <a href="https://glab.caltech.edu/">Prof. Viviana Gradinaru</a>. During college, I also studied abroad at the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>, as a member of <a href="https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/">St. John's College</a>. I also previously conducted computational biology research at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> in the <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/elias/about.html">Elias Lab</a> and the <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/urbanlab">Urban Lab</a> and psychology and anthropology research at Stanford and <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a> under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/tcpsych/faculty/michael-lifshitz">Prof. Michael Lifshitz</a> and <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/tanya-luhrmann">Prof. Tanya Luhrmann</a>.
